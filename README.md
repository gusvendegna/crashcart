Absolutely—here’s a polished `README.md` tailored for your MJPG-streamer-based HDMI-over-IP project, now officially called **Crash Cart** 🚑🎥

```markdown
# 🧰 Crash Cart

**Crash Cart** is a plug-and-play HDMI capture streamer in a Docker container. Designed for IT admins, makers, and hardware wranglers, it lets you view the screen of any HDMI device (server, SBC, camera, console) through a web browser—no monitor required.

Just plug in a USB HDMI capture device, run the container, and view the live feed from any device on your network.

## 📦 Features

- 🔌 Zero-config: auto-detects `/dev/video` capture devices
- 🌐 Web UI: stream available at `http://<ip>:8080/`
- ⚡ Fast load time with ultra-minimal Alpine base (~50MB image)
- 🔁 MJPEG stream via HTTP (instant preview in most browsers)
- 🔧 Configurable resolution & frame rate using environment variables
- 🐳 Multi-arch support (`armv7`, `amd64`)—works on Raspberry Pi, Jetson, etc.
- 🛡️ Optional password protection or local network-only access

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Plug in your USB HDMI capture device**

2. **Run the container:**

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --device=/dev/video0 \
  --privileged \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e RESOLUTION=1280x720 \
  -e FRAMERATE=30 \
  ghcr.io/<your-username>/crash-cart:latest
```

3. **Open your browser:**

```
http://<your-device-ip>:8080/
```

Done. You’re now streaming live.

## 🛠️ Build Locally

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/arm/v7 \
  -t crash-cart:local \
  --load .
```

---

## 🧪 Development Notes

- Built on MJPG-streamer with UVC input and HTTP output
- Static web UI replaces default streamer page with autoplay setup
- Use `v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext -d /dev/video0` to check supported modes
- Customize `/www/index.html` to modify appearance

---

## 🔐 Optional: Secure Your Stream

To restrict access, consider:
- Running behind a reverse proxy with basic auth
- Enabling local network firewall rules
- Tunneling over SSH/VPN
